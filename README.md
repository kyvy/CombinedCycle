# CombinedCycle

--------- TODO ---------

Brayton Cycle:

    Find actual (as opposed to isentropic) states. Then enthalpies.

    Find actual energies (qin, Wout, etc...)
    
    Find exergy destroyed, entropy generated by turbine and compressor and overall cycle

    Find efficiencies of turbine and compressor (second law, thermal)

    Find overall Brayton cycle efficiencies (second law, thermal)
    
    
Combined Cycle:
    
    Find efficiencies (thermal, second law)
    
    Find utilization factor
    
    Find total energies (output of brayton + rankine cycle, input, heat out, ....)
    
    Find total exergy destroyed and entropy generated
