# CombinedCycle

--------- TODO ---------

Brayton Cycle:

    Find actual (as opposed to isentropic) states. Then enthalpies.

    Find actual energies (qin, Wout, etc...)

    Find efficiencies of turbine and compressor (second law, thermal)

    Find overall Brayton cycle efficiencies (second law, thermal)
